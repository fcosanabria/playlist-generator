# Playlist Generator for Last.fm

## Description

This is a simple script that generates a playlist from your Last.fm account. It uses the [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api) to get your top tracks and then creates a playlist in the format of your choice.

For the moment this repo is only for my personal use and learning, but I plan to make it more general in the future.
